npm start

# For development mode
npm run dev
```

## To access the different pages

- The title page is loaded as it should at the start of the website
- The signup/login pages are loaded when clicking on the buttons of the same name, but it will redirect you to the next page if you fill the fields.
- Accounts handling still doesn't work, so the page is 100% a mockup.
- The main app page is in the same stage has the account page. Only difference to access is with the URL now needing "app.html". The generation of the card is in a very early stage, and the matchs at the bottom aren't real.
- The main endpoints are /index.html, /login.html, /singup.html, /app.html, account.html. If you enter a wrong url, you'll see the 404.html
