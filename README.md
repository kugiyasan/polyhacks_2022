# Pet Matcher
### Our 2022 polyhacks submission

## Installation
```sh
# Make sure you got node and npm installed locally
npm install
npm start

# For development mode
npm run dev
```

## To access the different pages :

- The title page is loaded as it should at the start of the website
- The signup/login pages are loaded when clicking on the buttons of the same name, but they don't work.
- The account page cannot be accessed by default. The only way to do so is by manually entering "account.html" at the end of the URL. Accounts handleling still doesn't work, so the page is 100% a mockup.
- The main app page is in the same stage has the account page. Only difference to access is with the URL now needing "app.html". The generation of the card is in a very early stage, and the matchs at the bottom aren't real.
